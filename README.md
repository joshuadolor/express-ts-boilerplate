# Express TypeScript Boilerplate

## Overview

This boilerplate provides a starting point for developing web applications with Express.js and TypeScript. It includes configuration for ESLint, nodemon for development, and basic project structure.

## Features

- **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **ESLint:** A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and fixing problems in your TypeScript code.
- **Nodemon:** A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and restarts the server automatically during development.
